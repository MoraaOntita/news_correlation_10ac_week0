## Motivation

Understanding the sentiment and topics covered by different media agencies can provide valuable insights into media biases and trends. This analysis can help stakeholders make informed decisions and strategies related to media consumption and content creation.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of media articles from various global media agencies. Each article includes metadata such as publication date, source, and content.

### Example Dataset Structure

- `articles.csv`: Contains the main dataset with the following columns:
  - `article_id`: Unique identifier for each article
  - `source`: Media source of the article
  - `publication_date`: Date when the article was published
  - `content`: Full text content of the article

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaning and normalizing the text data
   - Removing stop words, punctuation, and performing tokenization

2. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Using NLP techniques to determine the sentiment of each article (positive, negative, neutral)

3. **Topic Modeling**:
   - Applying topic modeling algorithms (e.g., LDA) to identify key topics covered in the articles

4. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Analyzing the correlation between sentiment, topics, and media sources
   - Visualizing the findings using interactive plots and dashboards

## Results

The results of this project include:
- Identification of key topics covered by different media agencies
- Sentiment distribution across various sources
- Correlation between topics and sentiment
- Insights into reporting biases and trends
